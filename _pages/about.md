I'm a PhD Candidate in Computer Science working with [Remco Chang](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~remco/) in the Visual Analytics Lab @ Tufts University (VALT), a research affiliate in the [MIT Visualization Group](https://vis.csail.mit.edu/), a research fellow in the [Visual Computing Group @ Harvard University](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/), and the co-founder and organizer of [Boston Vis](https://bostonvis.org/).

🎆🎆🎆

Excited to share that I’ll be on the job market for Fall 2026! I’m seeking opportunities as a research scientist or in a tenure-track faculty position at a U.S. university. Always happy to chat if you’re hiring or have advice to share.

In my research, I challenge traditional approaches to visualization design that often focus on highly specialized solutions for specific users, data, and tasks. Instead, I aim to transform the visualization design process into a systematic mapping from a problem space to a design space, particularly within the domain of decision-making. By applying qualitative research methods, I have found that my framework effectively describes decision-making problems, enables comparisons, and supports informed design decisions.

I graduated with a B.S. in Theoretical Mathematics from the [University of Maryland in College Park](https://umd.edu/), where I performed research within the [Graphics and Visual Informatics Laboratory (GVIL)](https://www.cs.umd.edu/gvil/). There, I was advised by [Amitabh Varshney](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~varshney/).

Both before and after starting my PhD, I worked for [Tableau Research/Salesforce](https://www.tableau.com/research) (Research Scientist Intern), [Alife Health](https://www.alifehealth.com/) (Data Science Contractor), and [Bose Corporation](https://www.bose.com/home) (Software Engineering Intern), and I collaborated with professors, research scientists and program managers at the [National Revenewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/), the [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/), [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), and [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/).

Outside academia, I like rock climbing, drawing frame-by-frame animations, and reading.
