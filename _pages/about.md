👩🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD Candidate in Computer Science working with [Remco Chang](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~remco/) in the Visual Analytics Lab @ Tufts University (VALT).

📝 In my research, I am challenging conventional paradigms in visualization design that tend to focus on specialized solutions tailored to individual users' data and tasks within specific domains. My domains of interest are Decision-Making and Healthcare.

👩🏻‍🎓 I graduated with a B.S. in Theoretical Mathematics from the [University of Maryland in College Park](https://umd.edu/), where I performed research within the [Graphics and Visual Informatics Laboratory (GVIL)](https://www.cs.umd.edu/gvil/). There, I was advised by [Amitabh Varshney](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~varshney/).

🤓 Both before and after starting my PhD, I worked for [Tableau Research/Salesforce](https://www.tableau.com/research) (Research Scientist Intern), [Alife Health](https://www.alifehealth.com/) (Data Science Contractor), and [Bose Corporation](https://www.bose.com/home) (Software Engineering Intern), and I collaborated with professors, research scientists and program managers at the [National Revenewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/), the [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/), [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), and [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/).

🌺 Outside academia, I enjoy picking up new hobbies, indulging in Art, Sports, and Reading.
