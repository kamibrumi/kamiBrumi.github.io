👩🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD Candidate at Tufts University.

🎆 I work with [Remco Chang](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~remco/) in the Visual Analytics Lab (VALT).

📝 In my research, I am challenging conventional paradigms in visualization design that tend to focus on specialized solutions tailored to individual users' data and tasks within specific domains. Some domains of interest are Decision-Making and Healthcare.

👩🏻‍🎓 I graduated with a B.S. in Theoretical Mathematics from the [University of Maryland in College Park](https://umd.edu/), where I performed research within the [Graphics and Visual Informatics Laboratory (GVIL)](https://www.cs.umd.edu/gvil/). There, I was advised by [Amitabh Varshney](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~varshney/).

🤓 Both before and after starting my PhD, I collaborated with professors, scientists, engineers and program managers at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), [Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)](https://www.wpi.edu/), [Tableau Research/Salesforce](https://www.tableau.com/research), [Alife Health](https://www.alifehealth.com/), and [Bose Corporation](https://www.bose.com/home).

🌺 Outside academia, I enjoy picking up new hobbies, indulging in Art, Exercising, and Reading.
